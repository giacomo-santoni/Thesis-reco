GOAL: apply the LPC algorithm on several patterns of event, in particular events with 2 and 3 tracks. Hence, I will take the lpc algorithm already implemented and I will improve it generalizing its usage for other patterns of events. I will have to be careful also to the presence of clusters. Their presence depends on the cut we choose. To avoid a too high influence of the cut in the analysis, we try to perform an analysis through the gradient: so we plot the gradient of the voxels instead of the voxel amplitude itself.
